# Zedway

Here is the code to my first-ever kinda huge project.
This is Zedway, a very instagram-esque social-media webapp.

This is something I built with my friends, where I coded the backend
(written in Django) and one of my friends did the frontend.

Due to this project being based on the MVC framework,
(and the fact that we had limited knowledge of such stuff back then),
the frontend was written in HTML/CSS, making the whole web-app,
kinda sluggish. It isn't up anymore, we took it down after a couple
of months, when we had around 200 users.

Even though this isn't the best, most polished project I've built,
it does have a special place in my heart, and I will always cherish it.
Thanks
